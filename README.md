# StudyProblems

#### Description:
My name is Johannes and I study medicine in Berlin. 

I feel that it can be difficult to keep track of questions 
concerning the courses as I often can't respond instantly.
This is why I came up with the idea of *StudyProblems*.

*StudyProblems* is a web application aiming to organise questions
you have concerning your courses and difficult questions you 
were asked. 

First of all, *StudyProblems* is of course a web app. So you can
- Register, sign in and out
- Change email and password
- Reset your password using a link sent to your email if you added one to your account
- Set preferences for email notifications

But then it is also a small social media platform, meaning that you can 
interact with other users by asking them questions and answering theirs. 
This means you can
- Sent and accept (or refuse) friend requests to / from other users
- Ask questions to your friends (always one friend per question so your friends are not annoyed by getting too many questions)
- Answer questions your friends asked you
- Get notified by in-app notifications when
  - you got a friend request
  - someone accepted or declined your friend request
  - someone removed you as a friend
  - someone asked you a question 
  - your friend answered your question
- Choose to be notified by email on important events 
  
**Important:** To use the app you should supply your email address and password in
config.py. Otherwise, the app can't send emails and might not work as expected.

I hope you enjoy playing with my project! :-)
